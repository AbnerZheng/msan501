# Storing data in S3 at AWS

## Goals

* Learn how to store and retrieve data in S3.
* Encrypt files stored at S3
 
## Description

S3 is cloud storage and is like having a disk where you can store files and directories at AWS.   The computers that you launch via EC2 have access to these files but you can also simply use S3 as a backup drive or a place to store data.

You have the choice to make files and directories public or private. Public files are visible to anyone who knows the URL.

From your console, select S3:

Click on the "Create bucket" button and choose a unique bucket name such as *userid*-msan501. Please note that this bucket will be unique across all users of S3. Select Northern California as the region. We always want to keep data close.

After it creates the bucket, it should show you the properties on the right. You can click on the properties button if it does not show you the properties. You will see permissions if you click on that subpanel.

That basically says you have control over the bucket and any files underneath.

Make sure you are looking at your bucket contents by clicking on the bucket name. It will show you an empty bucket. Use the "Upload" button to upload a sample file, such as `msan501/data/phones`. After you start the upload, it will finish and then show you something like this:

Now, let's make that file publicly visible. Right-click on `phones` and select "make public". Dialog box will ask you if you're sure. Yes, you are sure.

Select the file again and show its properties. You will see a link such as

`https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/parrt-msan501/phones`

that gives anybody with a web browser access to that file. Paste that into a browser and you will see that it downloads the `phones` file.

If you'd like to revoke those permissions, under properties and submenu permissions, simply delete the `Everyone` grantee:

AWS charges you very little for use of the storage but if you leave data up there you will get charged every month. For example, I get charged about $0.03 every month. Annoying but not enough to make me delete all of my temporary files up there. 

## Encrypting contents

For your practicum, you might want to store and retrieve data from your practicum partner via S3. If that is the case, you want to ensure that you the file is not public and then it might be a good idea to encrypted on S3.

Under the "Details" subtab of the properties for the file in question, turn on server-side encryption:

This means that it will be encrypted at AWS but it unencrypts it every time you ask for it, such as with a download. The idea is that if a hacker got into S3 and found your date on the disk, it would be useless to them because it would be encrypted. When you are logged in, you have access to the data and it will use your credentials to unencrypted before download.
