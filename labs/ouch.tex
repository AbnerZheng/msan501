-1/2 is -1 and 1/2 is 0 in Python.  There is no automatic promotion when you send an integer to a function that is expecting a floating-point number.

(-1/lambduh)*(np.log(1-u)) vs -(np.log(1-u))/lambduh. The latter is probably better because it does fewer floating-point operations and hence probably has fewer errors.
