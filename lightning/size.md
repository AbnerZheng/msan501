# Memory size requirements

1. How many bytes are needed to store an *ASCII* character? How about a UNICODE-16 character?
1. I have a subset of Wikipedia sitting on my disk and my Mac says it takes 5.3G. How many bytes is that?
2. If my disk is 1TB, how many copies of that subset could I store (assuming I didn't need space for anything else)
