# Memory size requirements

1. My first floppy disk held about 114k. How many bytes is that?
1. I have a subset of Wikipedia sitting on my disk and my Mac says it takes 5.3G. How many bytes is that?
2. If my disk is 1TB, how many copies of that subset could I store (assuming I didn't need space for anything else)
