MSAN501 -- Computational analytics
=======

Written by [Terence Parr](http://parrt.cs.usfca.edu), prof. of computer science and analytics at the University of San Francisco, with ideas from [the faculty](http://www.usfca.edu/artsci/msan/faculty/).

The content contained in this repository represents the labs and some raw notes for the 5-week computational analytics bootcamp of the [MS in Analytics program at the University of San Francisco](http://analytics.usfca.edu).

# Abstract

This course is specifically designed as an introduction to analytics programming for those who are not yet skilled programmers. The course also explores many concepts from math and statistics, but in an empirical fashion rather than symbolically as one would do in a math class. Consequently, this course is also useful to programmers who would like to strengthen their understanding of numerical methods.

# Administrivia

**ROOM.** 101 Howard first floor Rm 155-156.

**TIME.** Monday 1-5pm, Tues 10-12pm; July 11 (Mon) - August 9 (Tue).

**EXAMS.** There will be 2 exams and 1 final exam.

All projects are graded in binary fashion: They either work or they do not. Each project has a hard deadline and only those projects working correctly before the deadline get credit (100%).  My grading script pulls from github at the deadline. If you miss the deadline, you can still get 80% for the project if you complete it correctly by end of last class period.

## Instruction Format

Class periods of 1:05min each 3 times per week for 15 weeks. Instructor-student interaction during lecture is encouraged. All programming will be done in the Java programming language, unless otherwise specified.

**ABOUT ME.** My name is Terence Parr and I’m a professor in the computer science department.  Please call me Terence or Professor (the use of “Terry” is a capital offense). For more information on me, see [http://parrt.cs.usfca.edu](http://parrt.cs.usfca.edu).

**TARDINESS.** Please be on time for class. It is a big distraction if you come in late.

**ACADEMIC HONESTY.** You must abide by the copyright laws of the United States and academic honesty policies of USF. You may not copy code from other current or previous students. All suspicious activity will be investigated and, if warranted, passed to the Dean of Sciences for action.  Copying answers or code from other students or sources during a quiz, exam, or for a project is a violation of the university’s honor code and will be treated as such. Plagiarism consists of copying material from any source and passing off that material as your own original work. Plagiarism is plagiarism: it does not matter if the source being copied is on the Internet, from a book or textbook, or from quizzes or problem sets written up by other students. Giving code or showing code to another student is also considered a violation.

The golden rule: **You must never represent another person’s work as your own.**

If you ever have questions about what constitutes plagiarism, cheating, or academic dishonesty in my course, please feel free to ask me. I’m happy to discuss the issue in a forthright manner.

**Note:** Leaving your laptop unattended is a common means for another student to take your work. It is your responsibility to guard your work. Do not leave your printouts laying around or in the trash. *All persons with common code are likely to be considered at fault.*

**ON DISABILITIES.** If you are a student with a disability or disabling condition, or if you think you may have a disability, please contact USF Student Disability Services (SDS) at 415/422-2613 within the first week of class, or immediately upon onset of the disability, to speak with a disability specialist. If you are determined eligible for reasonable accommodations, please meet with your disability specialist so they can arrange to have your accommodation letter sent to me, and we will discuss your needs for this course. For more information, please visit http://www.usfca.edu/sds/ or call 415/422-2613.
